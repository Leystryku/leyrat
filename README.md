LeyRAT  Remote-Administration Tool in C++ (think of TeamViewer)

# LeyRAT
___

Hi. This is a remote administration tool including prototypes for crypting and some other stuff. It was initially made with the goal of keeping the client stub as small as possible, but later after issues with h264 encoding and me
being unjustified with mjpeg I decided to shift the goal. However, few weeks after I got bored of this and put it on hiatus. Since there's no one to sell this to, I'm releasing it for free. If you paste from this code, at least try giving credit, unlike most people in these kind of scenes. Don't be that guy.

(and no this isn't a new project, I made this @the first month of 2016/last december)

I  hereby place this project and its code to public domain
